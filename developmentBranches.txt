----------------------------------

code-devel: 

description: original development branch before split into different
development branches. This is a place to work on minor general
improvements before they are merged back to the trunk. I envision that
mergers will happen frequently as developments are brought to
completion. It also is intended to be kept in sync (as closely as
possible) with the public trunk. 

This branch is also currently the only private branch which is being
regression tested.

initial date: May 16, 2013

conditions: Merge when possible.

subscribers: LBL (Martin, Adams), Bristol (cornford),
