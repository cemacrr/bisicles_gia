<h1>BISICLES driver executable</h1>




BISICLES' driver executable is used to run standalone 
time-dependent ice sheet simulations. At the start of a  simulation, 
it carries out the following operations
<ol>
  <li>Read a <a href='io.html#config'>run-time configuration</a> file, specified as the first command line argument</li>
  <li>
    Compute initial thickness, topography, internal energy, stiffness and basal friction coeffcient 
    data over the whole domain on the base level (l = 0) mesh. This data might be loaded from a file through the
    <a href='leveldatainterface.html'>LevelData interface</a>, computed through the 
    <a href='pythoninterface.html'>Python interface</a> or through a number of special
    purpose modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set L = 0 and solve the stress-balance equations to find the velocity field on the l = 0 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate a new mesh with  L + 1  levels on which some regions are more
    finely resolved according to the refinement criteria
  </li>
  <li>
    Compute the thickness, topography, internal energy, damage and basal friction coeffcient 
    data on the  L + 1 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Solve the stress-balance equations to find the velocity field on the L + 1 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a plot file, including the thickness, topography, surface elevation, veleocity etc
  </li>
  <li>
    if L has not reached its maximum value, set L = L + 1 and repeat 3-7
  </li>
  
</ol> 
It then runs the following operations until the simulation has completed
<ol>
  <li>Write a check-point file, if required </li>
  <li>If time t > simulation time, exit, else continue </li>
  <li>Compute surface fluxes (accumulation and melting) given the geometry and velocity field  </li>
  <li>Compute horizontal thickness and internal energy fluxes given the geometry, velocity field and surface fluxes </li>
  <li>Evolve the thickness  and internal energy fields 
    for a time determined by the CFL condition</li>
  <li>Solve the stress-balance equations to find a new velocity field </li>
  <li>Write a plot file, if required </li>
  <li>Update the mesh according to the refinement criteria</li>
  <li>If needed, solve the stress-balance equations to find a new velocity field </li>
  <li>repeat from step 1</li>
</ol> 


<p>
It is also possible to <a href='io.html#restart'>restart</a> a simulation from a checkpoint file, for example 
to create a number of simulation branches, having carried out some sort of relaxation
