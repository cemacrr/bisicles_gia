<h1>BISICLES driver executable</h1>
</body>

BISICLES' driver executable is used to run time-dependent ice sheet simulations.
At the start of a  simulation, it carries out the following operations
<ol>
  <li>
    Compute initial thickness, topography, temperature, damage and basal friction coeffcient 
    data over the whole domain on the base level (L = 0) mesh. This data might be loaded from a file through the
    <a href='leveldatainterface.html'>LevelData interface</a>, or retrieved from the
    <a href='cisminterface.html'>CISM interface</a>, or computed through the 
    <a href='pythoninterface.html'>Python interface</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Solve the stress-balance equations to find the velocity field on the l = 0 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate a new mesh with  L + 1  levels on which some regions are more
    finely resolved according to the refinement criteria
  </li>
  <li>
    Compute the thickness, topography, temperature, damage and basal friction coeffcient 
    data on the  L + 1 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Solve the stress-balance equations to find the velocity field on the L + 1 mesh
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a plot file, including the thickness, topography, surface elevation, veleocity etc
  </li>
  <li>
    if L has not reached its maximum value, set L = L + 1 and repeat 3-7
  </li>
  
</ol> 
It then runs the following operations until the simulation has completed
<ol>
  <li>Write a check-point file, if required </li>
  <li>If time t > simulation time, exit, else continue </li>
  <li>Compute surface fluxes (accumulation and melting) given the geometry and velocity field  </li>
  <li>Compute horizontal thickness fluxes given the geometry, velocity field and surface fluxes </li>
  <li>Evolve the thickness field for a time determined by the CFL condition</li>
  <li>Solve the stress-balance equations to find a new velocity field </li>
  <li>Write a plot file, if required </li>
  <li>Update the mesh according to the refinement criteria</li>
  <li>If needed, solve the stress-balance equations to find a new velocity field </li>
  <li>repeat from step 1</li>
</ol>
