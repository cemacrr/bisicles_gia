<h1><a name='title'> BISICLES Run-time configuration, input, output, and checkpoints </a></h1>

<h2> <a name='config'>Run-time configuration (inputs.* files)</a></h2>

<p>
The majority of BISICLES options are set in a configuration file which is specified 
at run time as the first command line argument of the  <a href='driver.html'>driver</a> and <a href='benchmark.html'>solverBenchmark</a>
programs, or in the initialization step of the programmable <a href='cdriver.html'>cdriver interface</a>. In the case of
driver, something like
</p>
<pre>
nohup mpirun -np 4 $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex inputs.mysim
</pre>
<p>
would specify inputs.mysim to be the configuration file. Some options may be set outside of this file, such
as petsc solver options (which can be set in a file .petsrc in the working directory). Within the configuration
file, options (with optional comments) are written like
</p>
<pre>
amr.plot_interval = 4 #  write a plot file every 4 steps
JFNKSolver.maxIter = 10 # cap the JFNK solver to 10 outer iterations
amr.ref_ratio = 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 # dx on level n is twice that of level n-1, for all n
</pre>
Later entries supersede earlier entries, e.g
<pre>
amr.plot_interval = 4 #  write a plot file every 4 steps
amr.plot_interval = 2 #  write a plot file every 2 steps
</pre>
is the same as just
<pre>
amr.plot_interval = 2 #  write a plot file every 2 steps
</pre>

<p>
  Note that BISICLES can run in user-defined time units: the default is the tropical year. To chose
  seconds instead, set 
</p>
<pre>
constants.seconds_per_unit_time = 1.0
</pre>
<p>
  In that case, make sure that e.g surface mass balance is specified in m/s (as opposed to m/a).
  Likewise, ensure that the rate factor (A in Glen's law) and the basal traction coefficient
  are given in the correct units.
</p>



<h2> <a name='pout'>Log output (pout.* files)</a></h2>

<p>
Non-mpi executables write a log is to stdout, while mpi executables write to files called (by default) pout.0, pout.1, one
for each processor. These are fairly verbose by default: grep is your friend, and are the most effective way to
be sure that a simulation is behaving (e.g the progress of the velocity solver, which is the hardest and
most time consuming part of the code is reported in some detail). Optionally specify the file
name (for mpi binaries) with
</p>
<pre>
main.poutBaseName = pout.something
</pre>
<p>
to get pout.something.0, pout.something.1, etc. Either absolute or relative paths can be specified.
</p>
<h2> <a name='plot'>Plot files (plot.*.2d.hdf5 files) </a></h2>
<p>
Ice sheet snapshots, containing spatially varying fields such as ice thickness and velocity can be  written either
at regular time steps or times. For example, set
</p>
<pre>
amr.plot_interval = 32
amr.plot_prefix = plot.mysim.
</pre>
<p>
to produce a file every 32 timesteps, with a names like plot.mysim.000000.2d.hdf5, plot.mysim.000032.2d.hdf5, plot.mysim.000064.2d.hdf5 , etc 
Note that, in most cases the time step is variable, so the file names will not given much information about the
times between them. It is possible, but not recommended, to fix the time step, with, e.g
</p>
<pre>
amr.fixed_dt = 0.125
</pre>
<p>
To have plot files written at particular time interval, set
</p>
<pre>
amr.plot_time_interval = 1.0 # time between plot file in years
</pre>
<p>and do not set (e.g)</p>
<pre>
amr.plot_interval = 32
</pre>
<p>
Provided the time interval is {... 1/4 , 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ...} it might also be worth
setting
</p>
<pre>
amr.time_step_ticks = 1
</pre>
<p>
which will restrict the time step to a value in {... 1/4 , 1/2, 1, 2, 4, ...} , 
</p>

<p>
There are several options that determine which fields are included in the plot files. With default
values they are
</p>
<pre>
amr.reduced_plot = false; # if true, write a reduced set of fields
amr.write_solver_rhs = false; # if true, include the right hand side of the stress equation (gravity)
amr.write_dHDt = true; # if true, write the ice thickening rate
amr.write_fluxVel = true; # if true, write the vertically averaged mass flux velocity
amr.write_viscousTensor = false; # if true, write the effective drag and viscosity, plus components of the stress tensor
amr.write_baseVel = true; # if true, write the velocity at the ice base
amr.write_internal_energy = false; # if true, include the internal energy density of each vertical layer, plus surface and base 
amr.write_thickness_sources = false; # if true, write the surface and basal thickness fluxes (SMB and melt-rate)
amr.write_layer_velocities = false; # if true, write the horizontal velocity at each vertical layer
amr.write_mask = false;# if true, write the grounded/floating/land/sea mask
</pre>

<p>
  By default, files are numbered with the timestep (e.g plot.mysim.000032.2d.hdf5 corresponds timestep 32),
  but it is possible to have them numbered otherwise: the options are
</p>
<pre>
  amr.output_file_numbering = time_yyyymmdd_360 # divides the year into 12 months of 20 days e.g 20010401 for 1 April 2001
  amr.output_file_numbering = time_years # a long integer time in years
  amr.output_file_numbering = time_seconds # a long integer time in seconds
</pre>


<h2> <a name='plotcf'>CF Plot files (plot.*.CF.2d.hdf5 files) </a></h2>
<p>
CF plot files are alternative (or complement) to the <a href='#plot'>standard plot file format</a>
that are designed to produce  <a href='http://cfconventions.org/'>Climate and Forecast (CF)</a>
compatible data. They differ from the standard files in several respects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They include a single mesh level, and data from coarser or finer levels is interpolated/coarsened as needed)</li>
  <li>The fields are time-averaged rather than snapshots: each file contains the time means since the previous
    file was written</li>
  <li>Time sequences of domain wide data (such as ice volume) are included: these span the time interval since the previous
    file was written</li>
  <li>The output fields (ice thickness etc) are labeled with to CF standard names</li>
</ol>
<p>
The files produced are not themselves CF-compliant, because they are
hdf5 rather than netcdf files, but the flatten <a href='filetools.html'>file tool</a> can
create CF compliant netcdf files from the a plot.*.CF.2d.hdf5 file. To convert
plot.X.CF.2d.hdf5, run (for example)
</p>
<pre>
  $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/filetools/flatten2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex plot.X.CF.2d.hdf5 plot.X.nc 0
</pre>
<p>
  which will also construct some metadata, e.g specify the projection. To enable CF plot files, disable the standard files and include some typical data:
</p>
<pre>
amr.plot_style_cf = true
amr.plot_style_amr = false # leave out to have both sorts of file
CFIO.land_ice_thickness = true # note the form: CFIO.standard_name = true
CFIO.land_ice_basal_velocity = true
CFIO.surface_altitude = true
CFIO.bedrock_altitude = true
CFIO.whole_domain_diagnostics = true # write ice volume, etc.

#specify the coordinate system - optional for BISICLES but needed for CF compliance
CRS.EPSG = 3031 # EPSG is the only system supported for now
CRS.origin_x = 1.234 # the coordinates of the point (0,0) on (all) BISICLES levels 
CRS.origin_y = 5.678 # (measured in metres)
</pre>

<h2> <a name='restart'>Checkpoints (chk.*.2d.hdf5 files) and restarts </a></h2>
<p>
BISICLES will periodically write a checkpoint file. Although these are hdf5 files, they cannot be viewed in visit etc
and are intended only allow simulations to pick up from a point during a previous simulation. To write
a checkpoint every 32 time steps, for example set
</p>
<pre>
#check points
amr.check_interval = 32
amr.check_prefix = chk.mysim.
amr.check_overwrite = 0
</pre>
<p>
which will produce files chk.mysim.000000.2d.hdf5, chk.mysim.000032.2d.hdf5, chk.mysim.000064.2d.hdf5, etc. 
These files can be large, and I/O can be expensive, so avoid writing too many. By setting 
</p>
<pre>
amr.check_overwrite = 1
</pre>
<p>
each checkpoint will be called chk.mysim.2d.hdf5 and overwrite the previous file. We advise avoiding this
option. Firstly, if the program aborts midway through I/O (through running out of time on a cluster, or disk space), 
the file will be corrupt, and at least if there are a series you can go back to the previous file. Secondly, 
keeping a reasonable number of checkpoints allows you to construct s set of branching simulations not
necessarily envisaged to begin with.
</p>

<p>
To restart a simulation from a checkpoint add the option
</p>
<pre>
amr.restart_file = &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
<p>
to the configuration file. An obvious use for checkpoints is to create
a number of simulation branches, having carried out some sort of relaxation.
In that case, it might be desirable to set
</p>
<pre>
amr.restart_time = 0.0
amr_restart_set_time = true
</pre>

<p>An effective strategy when running simulations
on clusters that impose a time limit is to write checkpoint files 
frequently, and then write job submission scripts that look for the
latest checkpoint file and append options to the input file. Make
sure you also append
</p>
<pre>
amr_restart_set_time = false
</pre>
<p>
The following script template was designed for ARCHER. The script is submitted from 
a given directory (which will set $PBS_O_WORKDIR). When it runs, each job 
creates its own numbered working sub-directory, so that log output is separated. 
plot and checkpoint files are written to ../ - which will be  $PBS_O_WORKDIR.
Subsequent runs of the same script will be restarted from the last checkpoint.
If  you copy this script, make sure you replace all the &lt;variables&gt;
</p>
