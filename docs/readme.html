<h2><a name="sysreq"> System requirements.</a></h2>
<p> 
  BISICLES requires the GNU/Linux operating system (actually, it should compile and run elsewhere,
  but we never do that), plus both C++ and FORTRAN compilers, a GNU-compatible make, and Perl.
  On the whole, life is easiest with gcc (including g++ and gfortran), and we shall assume that
  is what will be used. To build the parallel version, you need an MPI environment, which provides 
  the mpicc and mpicxx  (or equivalents). You will also need 
  <a href='https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/home.html'>VisIt</a></li> to view the data BISICLES 
produces (other programs can be put to use, but VisIt is by far the most convenient)</p>
<p>
  There are some <a href='sites.html'>site specific notes</a> 
</p>
<h2><a name="svnco"> Check out the source code.</a> </h2>
<p> Since this readme file lives in the source code repository, you might have already checked the source code
  out. There are two source trees, Chombo, and BISICLES, and the rest of this guide assumes that you
  have a directory called $BISICLES_HOME which contains the two.</p>

<p> To obtain the source trees, you first need an <a href='https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/'>ANAG repository account</a>.
  Once that is sorted out, create a root directory for both source trees
<pre>
  > export BISICLES_HOME=/wherever/you/like #assumes bash...
  > mkdir -p $BISICLES_HOME
  > cd $BISICLES_HOME
  > svn co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/Chombo/release/3.1 Chombo 
  > svn co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/BISICLES/public/trunk BISICLES 
</pre>
</p> 


<h2><a name="deps"> Dependencies.</a> </h2>
<p>
  Chombo requires the hdf5 libraries. The current version of hdf5 is 1.8. However, Chombo was written to build against version 1.6, which has a somewhat different interface than 1.8. Luckily, the hdf5 developers took this into account and provided a backwards compatible 1.6 interface in the current release. Two approaches to hdf5 will work:
<ul>
<li> One could simply download the older 1.6 version of hdf5 and build against that one. </li>
<li> Alternatively, the current 1.8 release may be used as long as the compilation flag "-DH5_USE_16_API" is added.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The rest of the instructions in this document employ the first approach, but the compatibility flag is included in the provided Makefile setup, so one can also use hdf5 1.8 if that is more convenient (and is recommended if using a shared resource which may already have an up-to-date hdf5 installation.)

<p>  Glimmer-CISM also requires netcdf, and in a non-standard configuration to boot. BISICLES
  includes some complementary tools which require netcdf. So, while you could use the
  version installed on your system 
  it is often simpler to compile netCDF from source.
</p>
<p>
  There should be a script, download_dependencies.sh that will get the (version 1.6) hdf5 sources and  
  unpack them, twice : once into hdf5/serial/src and once into hdf5/parallel/src. 
  It assumes $BISICLES_HOME is set. It should contain the following
<pre>
cd $BISICLES_HOME

#get hdf5 sources

if !(test -e hdf5-1.6.10.tar.gz) then
    echo "downloading hdf5-1.6.10.tar.gz"
    wget http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/prev-releases/hdf5-1.6.10/src/hdf5-1.6.10.tar.gz
fi

tar -zxf hdf5-1.6.10.tar.gz -C hdf5/parallel/src
tar -zxf hdf5-1.6.10.tar.gz -C hdf5/serial/src

#get netcdf sources

if !(test -e netcdf-4.1.2.tar.gz) then
    echo "downloading netcdf-4.1.2.tar.gz"
    wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4.1.2.tar.gz
fi

tar -zxf netcdf-4.1.2.tar.gz -C netcdf/parallel/src
tar -zxf netcdf-4.1.2.tar.gz -C netcdf/serial/src
</pre>


  If you want to build a single-processor BISICLES, then build hdf5 in hdf5/serial/src, 
  and if you want to build a multi-processor BISICLES, then build hdf5 in hdf5/parallel/src.
  Similar pairs of directories will be built for netcdf.
</p>
<h3>Building serial hdf5 </h3>
Before starting, make sure that you can run gcc.
Enter the appropriate source directory
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/src/hdf5-1.6.10/
</pre>
and configure hdf5 like so
<pre>
CC=gcc CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/ --enable-shared=no
</pre>
note the --enable-shared=no. This isn't strictly necessary - you could use shared libraries -
but we find they are more trouble than they are worth, especially when running on clusters.
The -fPIC flag will be useful later if you want to build the experimental libamrfile.so 
shared library that can be used to manipulate Chombo (and BISICLES) output with languages 
that support a plain C function calling convention, like FORTRAN 90 and GNU R (and hopefully MATLAB). 
Configure will spit out a long list of tests, and hopefully pass the all to produce a report
that reads as follows:
<pre>

</pre>
Don't worry that the C++ and Fortran languages are not enabled : Chombo uses the C interface, 
and (when we come to compile that too), so does netcdf. Assuming this is all OK, type
<pre>
> make install
</pre>
and you, after a round of compiling and copying, you 
should see that the hdf5 libraries bin,doc,include and src have appeared in $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/.
</p>
<h3>Building parallel hdf5 </h3>

Before starting, make sure that the mpi environment is in place and that you can run mpicc.
Enter hdf5/parallel/src/hdf5-1.6.10/ directory
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/src/hdf5-1.6.10/
</pre>
and configure hdf5, this time enabling MPI through the use of mpicc in place of gcc
<pre>
> CC=mpicc ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/ --enable-shared=no
</pre>
This time, configure's final report should read
<pre>
Configure Summary
Compiling Options:
               Compilation Mode:  Production
                     C Compiler:  mpicc

  Statically Linked Executables:  No
                        Tracing:  No
   Optimization Instrumentation:  No

Languages:
----------
                            C++:  No
                        Fortran:  No

Features:
---------
                        dmalloc:  No
         Function Stack Tracing:  Disabled
                           GPFS:  No
      Strict File Format Checks:  Disabled
        HDF5 v1.4 Compatibility:  No
         I/O filters (external):  deflate
         I/O filters (internal):  shuffle,fletcher32
 Linux Large File Support (LFS):  Enabled
                            MPE:  No
                  Parallel HDF5:  Yes
                   Threadsafety:  Disabled
             High Level library:  Enabled

</pre>
Note especially the line 'Parallel HDF5:  Yes'
</body>
Assuming this is all OK, type
<pre>
> make install
</pre>
this time, the bin,doc,include and src directories should end up  in $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/.
</p>

<h3>Building serial netcdf </h3>
<p>
<strong>This doesn't work with NetCDF 4.1.3</strong>, which wants some part of the hdf5 library than only exists in version 1.8. Hopefully, we should
be able to resolve this by building hdf5 1.8 to be compatible with hdf5 1.6 (the option exists) but for now, we'll stick with netcdf 4.1.2.
</p>
<p>
Before starting, make sure that you can run gcc,g++ and gfortran.
Enter the appropriate source directory
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial/src/netcdf-4.1.2/
</pre>
Now, netcdf needs to link hdf5 : it doesn't really matter which version but we might as
well use the one we have. Also, we want to avoid building a separate fortran library (libnetcdff.a);
instead we want to include both C and FORTRAN stubs in libnetcdf.a. So, we have 
a custom configure line
<pre>
> CC=gcc CXX=g++ FC=gfortran LDFLAGS=-L$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/lib/  ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial  --enable-separate-fortran=no --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes --enable-dap=no
</pre>
Next, compile, test, and install netcdf
<pre>
> make check install
</pre>
and assuming all goes well, netcdf 4.1.2 will now be installed in $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial
</p>
<h3>Building parallel netcdf </h3>
<p>
<strong>This doesn't work with NetCDF 4.1.3</strong>, which wants some part of the hdf5 library than only exists in version 1.8. Hopefully, we should
be able to resolve this by building hdf5 1.8 to be compatible with hdf5 1.6 (the option exists) but for now, we'll stick with netcdf 4.1.2.
</p>
<p>
So far, the only difference between parallel and serial netcdf installs 
is the link to parallel hdf5 and the use of the MPI compiler wrapper. 
Possibly, building two versions of netcdf is a waste of time.
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/parallel/src/netcdf-4.1.2/
> CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx  LDFLAGS=-L$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/lib/  ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/parallel  --enable-separate-fortran=no --enable-shared=no --enable-static=yes --enable-dap=no
> make check install
</pre>
</p>
<h2><a name="chombo">Chombo configuration</a></h2>
<p>
Next we need to set up Combo's configuration (which BISICLES will inherit automatically).
The main task here is create a file called $BISICLES_HOME/Chombo/lib/mk/Make.defs.local,
and there is version stored in this directory that should be easy enough to edit.
First, copy it into $BISICLES_HOME
<pre>
> cp $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/docs/Make.defs.local $BISICLES_HOME
</pre>
At the very least, you will need to  edit the line that reads
<pre> 
BISICLES_HOME=..., 
</pre>
to give the correct value. If you don't have MPI, there are a few lines to comment out. 
You might also want to tinker with the optimization flags and so on. Then create a link
so that Chombo sees Make.defs.local in the place it expects
<pre>
>ln -s $BISICLES_HOME/Make.defs.local $BISICLES_HOME/Chombo/lib/mk/Make.defs.local
</pre>

<h2><a name="python">Configuring the Python interface</a></h2>
<p>
To make use of the <a href='pythoninterface.html'>python interface</a>, you need to ensure that you have a suitable
python installation. This is usually straightforward in modern GNU/linux distributions,
since Python is so widespread. Before you can compile BISICLES with Python support, 
find out <ol>
<li>where the header file &quot;Python.h&quot; lives; /usr/include/python2.6, for example</li>
<li>what linker flags you need, for example -lpython2.6
</ol>
Now, edit the file
<pre>
$BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs
</pre>
to define the variables PYTHON_INC and PYTHON_LIBS. There are several examples in the file already.
</p>

<p>when you come to compile BISICLES, you should see flags like -DHAVE_PYTHON included in the compilation</p>


<h2><a name="bisicles">Building stand-alone BISICLES</a></h2>

<p>Now we are ready to build one or more BISICLES executables. If you plan to do development
work on the code itself, you will want to build an unoptimized version to run in gdb. Run
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all
</pre>
This will build a set of Chombo libraries, and then BISICLES. Hopefully, it will complete without errors, and you
will end up with an executable called <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.ex</quote>. 
This one is most useful for low-level debugging of the code - if you 
are not planning to do that, there is no need for it.  If you have a serial computer only, run
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all OPT=TRUE
</pre>
to get an optimized executable called <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex</quote>. 
</p>
An optimized  parallel executable <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex</quote> can be built like so
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE
</pre>
For serious runs, this is the one you need. Even on workstations with a few processors (like dartagnan.ggy.bris.ac.uk) noticeable (2X-4X)  speed improvements are realized by running parallel code, and on clusters like bluecrystal or hopper.nersc.gov we have obtained 100X speedups for big enough problems (and hope to obtain 1000X speedups).
<p>
<p>
Finally, should you feel the urge, you can have a non-optimized parallel version, which can be used for hunting down low-level
bugs that crop up in parallel operation but not in serial operation. 
</p>

<h2><a name="makeclean">Make clean</a></h2>
<p>On occasion it might be necessary to rebuild BISICLES entirely, rather than just those parts where a file
has changed. To do so, run
<pre>make clean</pre>
for unoptimized, serial builds, 
<pre>make clean OPT=TRUE</pre>
for optimized serial builds, and
<pre>make clean OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE</pre>
for optimized parallel builds</p>

<h2><a name="makerealclean">Make realclean</a></h2>
<p> In the event even more houscleaning is desired, the "realclean" target does everything the "clean" target does, and additionally removes many other user-generated files, including all files with the ".hdf5" suffix (including checkpoint and plot files). 

<h2><a name="example">Running BISICLES on a simple problem</a></h2>
<p>
All the data to run <a href='http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/welcome.html'>Frank Pattyn's MISMIP3D P075 experiment</a> is already
present. Change to the MISMIP3D subdirectory, and generate some input files from a template.
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/examples/MISMIP3D
> sh make_inputs.sh
</pre>
then we are ready to go.
</p>
<h3>Running on a serial Workstation</h3>
On a serial machine, try the 3 AMR level problem (which will have
a resolution of 800 m at the grounding line, and 6.25 km far from it).
<pre>
$BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex  inputs.mismip3D.p075.l1l2.l3 > sout.0 2>err.0 &
</pre>
You can watch progress by typing
<pre>
> tail -f sout.0
</pre>
and eventually, you will get a series of plot*2d.hdf5 files that you can view in visit
</p>

<h3>Running on a parallel Workstation</h3>
If you have a parallel machine, run the 5 AMR level problem (which will have
a resolution of 200 m at the grounding line, and 6.25 km far from it).
<pre>
> nohup mpirun -np 4 $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex inputs.mismip3D.p075.l1l2.l5 &
</pre>
replace -np 4 with the appropriate count for your machine: this is usually <strong>not</strong> the number
of CPU cores because these will typically share some resources. A good guess is 
the number of memory buses. Ideally, do a series of scaling experiments
to come up with a graph like this one 
</p>

<p>
You can watch progress by typing
<pre>

</pre>
and eventually, you will get a series of plot*2d.hdf5 files that you can view in visit
</p>
<h3>Running on a cluster</h3>

See the <a href='sites.html'>Site specific notes</a>

<h3><a name='nctoamr'>Compiling and using the file tools</a></h3>
<p>
To compile the file tools you might need to edit file $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs. 
If you have installed BISICLES (and netcdf in particular) following this guide, there should be no need, but otherwise
make sure that the variable NETCDF_HOME points to the parent directory of the netcdf include and lib directories.
There is little point in building parallel file tools, so type
<pre>
make all
</pre>
now, say you have a NetCDF file called data.nc, which contains 2D fields named thk and topg arranged on a regular
grid (with equal spacing in x and y), and must also contain a 1D field called x, you can run
<pre>
$BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/filetools/nctoamr2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.ex data.nc data.2d.hdf5 thk topg
</pre>  
to obtain a file called data.2d.hdf5 that BISICLES can read as (say) thickness and topography data. 
</p>
There are a number of other <a href='filetools.html'>file tools</a>.

<h3><a name='control'>Compiling the control problem code</a></h3>
<p>
  The control problem code is used to solve an optimization problem (inverse problem, or ill-posed problem),
  using the optimal control methods described by (e.g) MacAyeal (1993) Journal of Glaciology, vol 39 p 91
  and elsewhere. It lives somewhat apart from the rest on BISICLES, and has its own executable
 <pre>
   cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/control
   make all OPT=TRUE #compile a serial optimized version
   make all OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE #compile a parallel optimized version
</pre>
 There is a <a href='pineislandcontrol.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a> which shows how to run the control problem
 and what to do with its results.
