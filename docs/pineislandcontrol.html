  <H1>BISICLES Pine Island Glacier control problem</H1>
  <p> These instructions assume that you have working BISICLES executables, including control, driver 
     and nctoamr. If that is not the case, there are some <a href='../readme.html'>BISICLES build instructions</a>
     Anne Le Brocq has provided us with the data for this application - thanks Anne. You also
    need to have followed at least the preprocessing step of the first <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example.
