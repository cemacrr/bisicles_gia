<h1>Viewing BISICLES output with VisIt</h1>
<p>
VisIt can be obtained from <a href='https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/'>https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/</a>.
<p>

<p>
  This document aims to show how you can view BISICLES data in VisIt by describing the steps
  necessary to produce a video of Pine Island Glacier retreating from the data produced in the
  <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>. So, run that example before you continue.
  We assume you have installed VisIt on a workstation that has direct access to the plot files, 
  although it is also possible (and often more convenient) to use the remote host features of
  VisIt to view remote files.
</p>

<h2>Opening a string of files</h2>
<p>
From VisIt's main Window, select File -&gt; Open. Use the resulting file dialog
to browse to the directory where the plot files are stores. In the screenshot
below, we have used a filter 'plot*hdf5' to avoid seeing a whole bunch of files (including
check point files called chk*hdf5) that VisIt can't open. If you also select 
&quot;Smart File Grouping&quot; the various plot files
should be grouped together into a notional object, in this case called 
<pre>
plot.pigv5.1km.l1l2.4lev.*hdf5 database
</pre>
</p>
<img src='visit_file_dialog.png' alt='the visit file dialog'/>
<p>
Select that object, and it should appear as the &quot;Active Source&quot
on VisIt's main window.
</p>

<ol>
<li>choose Plots -&gt; Add -&gt; psuedocolor -&gt; basal_friction
(from the toolbar about halfway down the main window). Double click the
item that appears in the Plots list title Psuedocolor - basal friction, 
and modify the resulting dialog to give a maximum value of 1, change
the Color table to &quot;gray&quot; and the Opacity to 25%.
</li>
<li>choose Plots -&gt; Add -&gt; psuedocolor -&gt; Vel_magnitude
(from the toolbar about halfway down the main window). Double click the
Vel_magnitude item, 
and modify the resulting dialog to give a log scale, a mimimium value of 1 and
a  maximum value of 1e3. Change the Color table to &quot;bluehot&quot;
</li>
<li>choose Plots -&gt; Add -&gt; subset -&gt; levels. Double Click the
Subset - levels item and check the wireframe box in the resulting dialog.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Click the Draw button, and you should see an image like this:
</p>
<img src='visit_image_1.png' alt='PIG speed map produced by visit'/>
<p>
The colormap shows the ice flow speed, while the use of a translucent mask
derived from basal_friction outlines the ice shelf. The progressively small
and gaudy boxes indicate regions of high resolution - in th eimage above, the smallest boxes
are regions of 250m resolution. If you only see large
boxes, make sure &quot;Apply subset selections to all plots' (at the bottom
of VisIt's main window) is checked and the follow the Controls -&gt; subset -&gt;
menu item to select all levels.
</p>
<p>
Now you can use the Time slider in the main window, or the playback button below it,
or the playback button in the image window (&quot;Window 1;&quot) to watch
the grounding line retreat merrily up Pine Island Glacier's trunk, and the
mesh evolve with it so that high resolution is mainatined at the grounding line.
Feel free to add velocity vectors...
