Using filetool amrtocf with gdal


You need gdal. It may be already installed on your machine or you can download it and install it in your BISICLES home directory.


Pre-installed version

It should work provided that it was built with the same compilers as those for netdf and hdf5 packages and BISICLES.

Check the location of ogr_spatialref.h. 
Mine is in /usr/include/gdal rather than /usr/include. This means I had to edit the line 
#include "ogr_spatialref.h" 
in $BISICLES_HOME/code/filetools/src/Transformation.H to
#include "gdal/ogr_spatialref.h"


DIY

Download gdal package from www.gdal.org. 
I used the 'Developer Oriented Documentation' section and downloaded gdal-2.0.1.tar.gz

Instructions for installing gdal are under 'Buidling GDAL From Source', http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints. You need to configure gdal with --with-netcdf and --with-hdf5 set to the directory containing bin, include and lib for nectdf or hdf5. Remember to use the same compilers for all builds - main source of my errors!  

For example, on my Linux machine, porthos, I did the following:
tar -xvf gdal-2.0.1.tar.gz
cd gdal-2.0.1
mkdir $BISICLES_HOME/gdal
./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/gdal --with-netcdf=/home/glacio-shared/netcdf/ --with-hdf5=/usr/
make
make install 

You need to set the lib path to include gdal
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BISICLES_HOME/gdal/lib
I've added to my .bashrc file.


Compiling amrtocf with gdal

You need to edit $BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs. Set 
USE_GDAL = TRUE
and edit GDAL_HOME. 


Setting the projection

Edit amrtocf.cpp by setting
epsgval  : EPSG code number for a prescribed map projection.
x0, y0   : origin of the xy grid for the geometry data.
