<h1>BISICLES Thermodynamics</h1>

<p>
BISICLES has an optional thermodynamics component along the lines of Aschwanden et al, 2012
(doi: 10.3189/2012JoG11J088). It can be enabled by setting
</p>
<pre>
amr.isothermal = false
</pre>
<p>
  Following the Aschwanden et al 2012 model, the state variable, an energy density E
  (measured in J/kg), is composed from the temperature T and the water fraction w,
  such that E = CT + Lw, where C is the specific heat capacity, and L is
  the specific latent heat of fusion. 
</p>
<p>
  There are relatively few options to set for the thermodyanmics component:
  the initial energy density or temperature, and the boundary conditions
  at the upper and lower surface. The initial temperature
  is set in the same manner as a constant-in-time tempeartue. In the
  Pine Island Glacier example, temperature is read from an hdf5
  file with temperatures specified at the centers of layers which
  subdivide the ice thickness evenly, with the options
</p>
<pre>
amr.sigma = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
temperature.type = LevelData
inputLevelData.temperatureFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.temperatureName = temp000000
</pre>
<p>
  The file contains 10 variables, temp000000 to temp000009,
  specifying the temperature at sigma = 0.5,1.5, etc
</p>
<p>
  By default, the boundary condition at the upper surface
  prescribes zero heat flux. At the lower surface, the
  default geothermal flux is also zero, but the heat
  flux due to sliding friction is always imposed.
  The same means used to specify <a href='surfaceflux.html'>surface flux<a>
      for mass can be employed to set this fluxes, with
</p>
<pre>
  surfaceHeatBoundaryData.type = ...
  basalHeatBundaryData.type = ...
</pre>
<p>
  It is also possible to set an upper surface temperature, by
  setting
</p>
<pre>
    SurfaceHeatBoundaryData.Dirichlett = true
</pre>
<p>
  which then intpretts the field specified as a temperature rather
  than a heat flux.
