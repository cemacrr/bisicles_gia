<h1>BISICLES LevelData interface</h1>

BISICLES LevelData interface can load various kinds of gridded data from files in order to specify some
of 2D and 3D fields. Currently, these are:
<ol>
<li>the <a href='#ibc'>initial geometry and boundary conditions</a> (topography and thickness),</li>
<li>the <a href='#tempibc'>initial temperature</a>,</li>
<li>the <a href='#btrc'>basal traction coefficient</a>,</li>
<li>the <a href='#mucoef'>viscosity modifier coefficient</a>,</li>
<li> <a href='#sflux'>surface fluxes</a>, that is, accumulation and melting, and</li>
<li> all inputs to the <a href='control.html'>control problem</a></li>
</ol>

All of these require the same kind of input file, namely a Chombo amr file stored as hdf5, with
a single level of data covering the whole computational domain. This <strong>data level grid</strong>
will usually have a resolution that coincides with one of the AMR levels specified by the
input file parameters amr.num_cells,amr.maxLevel and amr.ref_ratio. More generally, it
can have a resolution which is 2^n (where n is an integer) times coarser or finer than any of the AMR levels.
The simplest way to produce the correct kind of file is to create a netcdf file and convert it with
the <a href='filetools.html#nctoamr'>nctoamr file tool</a>, as in the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>.

<h2><a name='ibc'>Initial geometry and boundary conditions</a></h2>
<p>
One of the most common data sources in ice sheet problems is the digital elevation map (DEM).
To load a DEM into BISICLES, determined the bedrock topograph and ice thickness, and
create an appropriate hdf5 file from those fields. 
In the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>, the following lines 
are used to select an initial geoemtry loaded from a file named 'pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5',
in which the relevant fields are called &quot;thk&quot; and &quot;topg&quot; 
<pre>
geometry.problem_type = LevelData
inputLevelData.geometryFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.thicknessName = thk
inputLevelData.topographyName = topg
</pre>
</p>
<p>
It is important to note the choice geometry.problem_type = LevelData also
implies the <strong>lateral boundary conditions as well as initial conditions</strong>.
By default, reflection boundary conditions (ice divides) are imposed on all four domain edges. This can
be changed to periodic boundary conditions in the usual way, e.g
<pre>
amr.is_periodic = 0 1 0
</pre>
selects reflection boundaries at the x-faces of the domain, but periodic boundaries at the y-faces.
To set a marine boundary condition at the domain edge, use DomainEdgeCalvingModel, e.g
<pre>
CalvingModel.type = DomainEdgeCalvingModel
CalvingModel.front_hi = 1 0    #impose a marine boundary at the high x-face 
CalvingModel.front_lo = 0 0
</pre>
On the other hand, if there is a calving front in the DEM, it can be fixed, e.g
it, use
<pre>
CalvingModel.type = FixedFrontCalvingModel
CalvingModel.min_thickness = 1.0
</pre>
as in the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>. This would force any regions
of the domain that begin ice-free to remain ice free, and prevent the ice thickness from dropping
below 1m in the rest of the domain.
