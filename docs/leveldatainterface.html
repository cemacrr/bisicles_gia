<h1>BISICLES LevelData interface</h1>

BISICLES LevelData interface can load various kinds of gridded data from files in order to specify some
of 2D and 3D fields. Currently, these are:
<ol>
<li>the <a href='#ibc'>initial geometry and boundary conditions</a> (topography and thickness),</li>
<li>the <a href='#tempibc'>initial temperature</a>,</li>
<li>the <a href='#btrc'>basal traction coefficient</a>,</li>
<li>the <a href='#mucoef'>englacial stiffness coefficient</a>,</li>
<li> <a href='#sflux'>surface fluxes</a>, that is, accumulation and melting, and</li>
<li> all inputs to the <a href='#inverse'>inverse problem</a></li>
</ol>

All of these require the same kind of input file, namely a Chombo amr file stored as hdf5, with
a single level of data covering the whole computational domain. This <strong>data level grid</strong>
will usually have a resolution that coincides with one of the AMR levels specified by the
input file parameters amr.num_cells,amr.maxLevel and amr.ref_ratio. More generally, it
can have a resolution which is 2^n (where n is an integer) times coarser or finer than any of the AMR levels.
The simplest way to produce the correct kind of file is to create a netcdf file and convert it with
the <a href='filetools.html#nctoamr'>nctoamr file tool</a>, as in the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>.

<h2><a name='ibc'>Initial geometry and boundary conditions</a></h2>
<p>
One of the most common data sources in ice sheet problems is the digital elevation map (DEM).
To load a DEM into BISICLES, determine the bedrock topography and ice thickness, and
create an appropriate hdf5 file from those fields. 
In the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>, the following lines 
are used to select an initial geometry loaded from a file named 'pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5',
in which the relevant fields are called &quot;thk&quot; and &quot;topg&quot; 
<pre>
geometry.problem_type = LevelData
inputLevelData.geometryFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.thicknessName = thk
inputLevelData.topographyName = topg
</pre>
</p>
<p>
It is important to note the choice geometry.problem_type = LevelData also
implies the <strong>lateral boundary conditions as well as initial conditions</strong>.
By default, reflection boundary conditions (ice divides) are imposed on all four domain edges. This can
be changed to periodic boundary conditions in the usual way, e.g
<pre>
amr.is_periodic = 0 1 0
</pre>
selects reflection boundaries at the x-faces of the domain, but periodic boundaries at the y-faces.
To set a marine boundary condition at the domain edge, use DomainEdgeCalvingModel, e.g
<pre>
CalvingModel.type = DomainEdgeCalvingModel
CalvingModel.front_hi = 1 0    #impose a marine boundary at the high x-face 
CalvingModel.front_lo = 0 0
</pre>
On the other hand, if there is a calving front in the DEM, it can be fixed, e.g
it, use
<pre>
CalvingModel.type = FixedFrontCalvingModel
CalvingModel.min_thickness = 1.0
</pre>
as in the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>. This would force any regions
of the domain that begin ice-free to remain ice free, and prevent the ice thickness from dropping
below 1m in the rest of the domain.

<h2><a name='tempibc'>Initial temperature</a></h2>

<p>See also the description of <a href='thermodynamics.html'>thermodynamics</a></p>

<p>
Temperature is a three dimensional field which is discretized over
a fixed number N of layers in the current version of BISICLES.
Each layer comprises a multi-level 2D field of cell-centered values which
is located at the layer midpoint. The data hdf5 file needs to have temperature data stored as N 
consecutive components, and the input file should give the name of the first.
BISICLES will then derive the temperature of the top layer from that 
first component, and the temperature of the remaining N-1 layers from the 
following N-1 components.
</p>

<p>
In the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>, the following
lines are relevant.</p>
<pre>
amr.num_cells = 64 96 10
amr.sigma = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0
temperature.type = LevelData
inputLevelData.temperatureFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.temperatureName = temp000000
</pre>
Note the 11 values of sigma; these are the values at the layer faces. 
The temperature values are stored at the layer midpoint, so 10 are needed, with
the first called &quot;temp000000&quot;.
