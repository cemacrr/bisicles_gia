<h1>BISICLES surface fluxes</h1>

<p>BISICLES has a number of configuration file options that let you specify the rate at which ice is
added to the ice sheet. Usually, there will be a source of ice thickness at the
upper surface, and one at the lower surface (or base). In the code we often 
call the first the 'surface flux'  and the second the 'basal flux' but this can be bit 
confusing because they are both, strictly speaking, 'surface fluxes'</p>

<p>First off, <strong>BISICLES changed the way surface fluxes were specified sometime in 2012</strong>. 
If you are seeing warnings that say 'trying to parse old style surface flux'
or 'trying to parse old style basal flux', then you likely have entries that read 
something like
<pre>
amr.surface_flux.type = ...
</pre>
<strong>We do plan to turn this warning into a fatal error, so if you see it, change to
the new style described below</strong>
</p>

<h2>surfaceFlux and basalFlux</h2>
<p>
There can be two relevant sections the inputs file, entries that
begin 
<pre> 
surfaceFlux.
</pre>
which select the thickness flux at the upper surface, and entries that
begin 
<pre> 
basalFlux.
</pre>
which select the thickness flux at the lower surface. If either is missing, we fall 
back to the older style (and you get the warning). Either section can specify one of
two kind of flux, simple fluxes and derived fluxes. Simple fluxes just specify a field
of values (which might be loaded from a file, or computed in some way), while
derived fluxes combine more than one simple flux. Derived fluxes can be used to 
apply one flux (which might itelf be a derived flux ) to floating ice and another to 
grounded ice, or to add a number of them together.
</p>

<h2>Simple fluxes</h2>

<h3>zeroFlux</h3>
<p>
If you want either flux to be zero, use this. e.g
<pre>
basalFlux.type = zeroFlux 
</pre>
</p>

<h3>constantFlux</h3>
<p>
Another straightforward type, where the flux doesn't depend on time or space.
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = constantFlux
surfaceFlux.flux_value = 0.3
</pre>
</p>
specfies 0.3 m/a accumulation at the upper surface across the whole domain.

<h3>piecewiseLinearFlux</h3>

This flux is used to construct a rate which
depends, in a piecewise linear fashiom, on the thickness
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
surfaceFlux.n = 2                       
surfaceFlux.abscissae = 50.0 500.0
surfaceFlux.ordinates = 0 -50.0
</pre>
would apply a rather odd flux to the upper surface. Between
thickness of 0 and 50 m, the flux is 0 m/a , while at 500 m and
above it is -50 m/a. It grows linearly from 0 to -50 in between.
This is used as part of a  maskedFlux to provide melt rates in the 
Pine Island Glacier example

<h3>LevelData</h3>

You use a LevelData surface flux to load a field of accumulation or melt
rates from one or more hdf5 files, in a similar fashion to 
topography and thickness. The data must be cell-centred and sit on 
a domain covering grid such that it can be refined or coarsened to
any of BISICLES levels. For example, the data can sit on a grid
that covers the whole domain at the coarsest level, or at some higher
level. Much of the time it will sit on the same grid as the topography etc.


Let's say you just have one field, acc, in one file, accfile.2d.hdf5, to
be applied for the whole run. Then you add lines like
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = LevelData
surfaceFlux.n = 1
surfaceFlux.timeStep = 1.0e+10
surfaceFlux.startTime = 0.0
surfaceFlux.fileFormat = accfile.2d.hdf5
surfaceFlux.name = acc
</pre>
On the other hand, lets say you have file accfile0000.2d.hdf5 to
accfile0100.2d.hdf5, which are to be applied from the start of year
0 to the start of year 100. Then you can have
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = LevelData
surfaceFlux.n = 100
surfaceFlux.timeStep = 1.0
surfaceFlux.startTime = 0.0
surfaceFlux.fileFormat = accfile%4d.2d.hdf5
surfaceFlux.name = acc
</pre>
You might have files accfile1980.2d.hdf5 to accfile2080.2d.hdf5,
in which case you can add
<pre>
surfaceFlux.offset = 1980
</pre>
which would see accfile1980.2d.hdf5 loaded at time t = 0. If
you need accfile1980.2d.hdf5 to be used every year up till
1980, and only then to start loading new data, add
</pre>
surfaceFlux.startTime = 1980
</pre>

You can use this in conjunction with the general option
amr.offsetTime, which lets us add a constant to BISICLES internal 
time. Say, for example, that you had
set 
<pre>
amr.offsetTime = 1926
</pre> 
Then after only 54 years of calculation (say a spin up) 
the 1980 file would be loaded. This is useful if you ran some kind of spinup, starting
at year 0, and decided to use the 54 year checkpoint file to 
initialize some production runs. However, all your files are named according
to a real year, and you would like to see real years in the plot files.

<h2>Derived fluxes</h2>

<h3>maskedFlux</h3>

maskedflux divides the domain into grounded ice, floating ice, open land, and open sea.
It is most often used to apply melting to the underside of ice shelves. In effect, it
expands the basalFlux. section (or surfaceFlux. section) to include
basalFlux.grounded., basalFlux.floating., basalFlux.openLand and basalFlux.openSea.
Each section assumes a zeroFlux by default, so
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type  = zeroFlux
basalFlux.floating.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.floating.flux_value = -100.0
</pre> 
gives zero flux everywhere except the shelf, where a melt rate of 100 m/a
is applied. 

<h3>boxBoundedFlux</h3>

Allows a flux to be resticted to the interior of a 
rectangular region
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = boxBoundedFlux
surfaceFlux.hi = 170.0e+3 500.0e+3 
surfaceFlux.lo = 100.0e+3 360.0e+3
surfaceFlux.flux.type = constantFlux
surfaceFlux.flux.flux_value = 1
</pre> 
Would apply a flux of 1 m/a in the box whose corners are (170 km , 100 km)
and (500 km , 360 km)

<h3>axbyFlux</h3>

Use axbyFlux to construct a flux F from two fluxes x and y, so that
F = a * x + b * y; a and b are scalars.  Below, we amplify a field loaded
from a file and add a constant to it.
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux

basalFlux.floating.type = axbyFlux
basalFlux.floating.a = 1.5

basalFlux.floating.x.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.x.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.x.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.x.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.x.fileFormat = melt-1km.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.x.name = melt

basalFlux.floating.b = 1.0
basalFlux.floating.y.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.floating.y.flux_value = -10.0
</pre>

<h3>compositeFlux</h3>

Use compositeFlux to specify an arbitary number of fluxes to be added
togther - useful in conjunction with boxBoundedFlux. The example
below  applies different piecewiseLinearFlux melt rates to
different regions of an ice shelf

<pre>

basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.grounded.flux_value = 0.0

basalFlux.floating.type = compositeFlux
basalFlux.floating.nElements = 2

#main shelf
basalFlux.floating.element0.type = boxBoundedFlux
basalFlux.floating.element0.hi = 170.0e+3 500.0e+3 
basalFlux.floating.element0.lo = 100.0e+3 360.0e+3
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.n = 2
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.abscissae = 250.0 500.0
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.ordinates = 0.0 -120

#slow shelf
basalFlux.floating.element1.type = boxBoundedFlux
basalFlux.floating.element1.hi = 100.0e+3 440.0e+3 
basalFlux.floating.element1.lo = 60.0e+3 360.0e+3
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.n = 2
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.abscissae = 300.0 500.0
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.ordinates = 0.0 -20
</pre>


<h3>groundingLineLocalizedFlux</h3>

<strong>This flux is incomplete, more options will be added</strong>
Constructs a flux from two fields G (grounding) and A (ambient), using the formula
H^m ( p * G + (1-p) * A). p is a function which decays
exponentially quickly away from grounded ice with 
a default scale length of 10 km and is equal to 1 on grounded ice. It is usually used within 
a masked flux to  impose strong melting near the current grounding line and 
a smaller ambient flux in the rest of the shelf. m = 0 by default.
In the example, we load two data fields from a file and combine them,
with m (powerOfThickness) = 1.0
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux

basalFlux.floating.type = groundingLineLocalizedFlux
basalFlux.floating.powerOfThickness = 1.0		
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.fileFormat = melt.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.name = glmelt

basalFlux.floating.ambient.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.ambient.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.ambient.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.ambient.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.ambient.fileFormat = melt.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.ambient.name = ambmelt
