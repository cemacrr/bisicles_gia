<h1>BISICLES Python Interface</h1>
<p>
<strong>The Python Interface is new and might change. You might need 
change your python function prototypes as it evolves.</strong>
</p>

<p>BISICLES' python interface is intended to make some of less performance intensive
parts of BISICLES easier to program. It is fairly crude : at certain points during a run BISICLES 
will use an embedded python intpreter to evaulate various fields. At the moment, it is possible to
specify the <a href='#ibc'>initial geometry</a> (topography and thickness), <a href='#flux'>surface 
fluxes</a> (that is, accumulation and melting), and the <a href='#btrc'>basal traction coefficient</a>. 
The most likely application of the Python
interface is in defining idealized problems, where the use of the <a href='leveldatainterface'>LevelData interface</a>
would lead to undesirable numerical error</p> 

<p>You should have included the python interface when <a href='readme.html'>building BISICLES</a>, otherwise
you will need to do so. You will need to run the appropriate <a href='readme.html#makeclean'>make clean</a></p>

<h2><a name='ibc'>Initial Geometry</a></h2>

<h2><a name='flux'>Surface Fluxes</a></h2>

It is possible to specify a <a href='surfaceflux.html'>surface flux</a> through a python function. You need to write
a python function that takes five scalar arguments (x,y,t,thickness,topography).
Let's say that you have created a file my.py
<pre>
#file my.py
def myflux(x,y,t,thck,topg):
    return 1.0e-3 * (thck + topg)
</pre>
then you would include lines like
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = pythonFlux
surfaceFlux.module = my.py
surfaceFlux.function = myflux
</pre>
in the input file.


<h2><a name='btrc'>Basal Friction Coefficient</a></h2>
