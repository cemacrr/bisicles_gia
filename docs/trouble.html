<h1>BISICLES common issues</h1>


<h2><a name='nocompile'>The code does not compile</a> </h2>

<h2><a name='norun'>The code compiles but does not run</a> </h2>

<h2><a name='crashes'>The code compiles and runs but crashes or fails
    in some spectacular way</a> </h2>

<p>
  Sometimes the code starts, but then terminates, leaving a
  more or less cryptic error in one other other log.

<ol>
  <li><strong>maxFaceVelocity &gt; 0.5 * HUGE_VEL</strong>.
    A very common error. It implies
    that the velocity solver - which can fail for many reasons,
    has produced an enormous speed somewhere. Start off by looking
    at the <a href='velocity.html'>velocity calculation</a>, but
    be aware that the velocity solver might be struggling because
    of its inputs - especially the <a href='geometry.html'>geometry</a>
  and the <a href='stress.html#basal'>basal traction</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name='drivel'>The code compiles and runs to completions but the
    results are drivel</a> </h2>

<p>
  Arguably, all results are like this :). But there are some things to watch out
  for
