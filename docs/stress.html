<h1>BISICLES stresses</h1>


<p>
Every BISICLES simulation requires both <a href='#basal'>basal</a>
and <a href='#basal'>englacial</a> stress models to be defined. These
relate basal and englacial stresses to the velocity field. There
are also options to modify the <a href='#driving'>driving</a> stress
</p>

<h2><a name='driving'>Driving stress</a></h2>

<p>
The driving stress is determined by the geometry, however there are some options
that can be used to modify it.  Input geoemtry may lead to isolated ares of
implausible driving stress, for example at tall ice cliffs. The option
</p>
<pre>
  velocity_rhs.max_rhs_dx = 1.0e+10 #(Pa m) :any floating point number > 1
</pre>
<p>
  is diasabled by default but will ensure that rho * g * h * |grad(s)| * dx &lt; velocity_rhs.max_rhs_dx
  1.0e+10 Pa m: roughly speaking a value of1.0e+10 Pa m:  corresponds
  to a 1 km high ice grounded cliff.
</p>
<p>
  Driving stresses are modified immediately upstream and downstream of the grounding line
  to avoid the combination of steep slopes and zero basal frcition that would otherwise
  arise. This is the one-sided scheme descibed in Cornford, J. Comput. Phys. 2013, and is enabled
  by default. It can be disabled with.
</p>
<pre>
  velocity_rhs.gl_correction = false # true is the default
</pre>

<h2><a name='basal'>Basal stresses</a></h2>

<p>
  The basal stress model is broken down into a spatially varying basal friction <a href='#btrc'>coefficient</a> beta^2(x,y)  
  and temperature dependent <a href='#bratefac'>rate factor</a> A(T),  which do not depend on velocity  and a 
  basal friction <a href='#btrr'>relation</a> f ( C, u), where C = \beta^2/A(T), which does. 
  A (T) = 1.0 by default. The simplest model is the linear viscous sliding law tau_b = C u, more complex rules 
  include the usual power law tau_b = \beta^2 |u|^{-2/3} u , and rules that depend on the effective pressure. 
  The code also include an additional linear basal traction term, so that the final rule applied is tau_b = f( C, u) + C_0 u 
  with C_0 used to impose, for example, drag from rocky fjord walls.  Note that whatever friction coeffcient is chosen, 
  it will only be applied to grounded ice or floating ice immediately adjacent to an 
  ice free region whose upper surface lies above the lower surface of the ice (a fjord wall).
</p>  

<h3><a name='btrc'>Basal friction coefficient</a></h3>
<p>
  If you have built the doxygen code documentation, the C++ class hierarchy underlying
  the basal friction coefficient is described at <a href='../code/doc/doxygen/html/classBasalFriction.html'>classBasalFriction.html</a>.

</p>

<h4>Floating and grounded ice</h4>

<p>
  By default, BISICLES sets  beta^2 = 0 for every cell whose center is grounded. Setting
</p>
<pre>
  basal_friction.grounding_line_subdivision = 4 # (any interger > 0, but 4 is recommended)
</pre>
<p>
  selects a sub-grid interpolation scheme, which proves useful in some circumstances (see e.g Cornford et at, Ann, Glac. 2016).
  The thickness above flotation is interploated between cell centers to compute a grounded-ice fraction w, with &lt; w &lt; 1,
  which is used to weight beta^2. At some point we may make this the default.
</p>

<p>
  The subgrid scheme typically means that a factor of two coarser mesh can be used. Note that BISICLES does not suffer
  from the much more severe truncation errors noted in Seroussi, The Cryopshere, 2014 when the subrgid scheme
  is not used: we attribute this to the one-sided difference scheme for the driving stress described in Cornford, J. Comput. Phys. 2013.
  This is enabled by default, but can be disbaled with
</p>
<pre>
  velocity_rhs.gl_correction = false # true is the default
</pre>

<h4>Drag from Rocky Walls</h4>
<p>
  Floating Ice flowing between rocky walls (e.g Petermann Glacier) experiences some drag by default,
  the coefficient C_0 is computed from the basal friction coefficient that would apply if
  the ice was grounded, and from the contact areas between ice and rock.
  It is possible to increase this drag with a scalar parameter.
</p>
<pre>
wall_drag.basic = true # default true
wall_drag.extra = 0.0 # default 0.0
</pre>

<h4>Drag in thin ice regions</h4>
<p>
  Realistic problems are sometimes made more difficult by the appearance of
  fast flowing  thin ice, often far from the regions of interest,
  which tends to reduce the stable time step. This
  can sometimes be mitigated by imposing some additional drag in thin ice
  regions. Be careful with this parameter - it can easily slow down ice shelves.
</p>
<pre>
thin_ice_drag.extra = 10.0 # default 0.0
thin_ice_drag.thickness = 10.0 # default 0.0
</pre>


<h4>Constant Friction</h4>

The simplest meaningful beta^2 is constant in space and time. E.g to set beta^2 = 1000 on all grounded ice:
<pre>
geometry.beta_type = constantBeta
geometry.betaValue = 1.0e+3
</pre>

<h4>Python Basal Friction</h4>

<p>See also the description of the <a href='pythoninterface.html'>python interface</a>.</p>

<p>If  beta^2 can be expressed as a simple function of <strong>local</strong>
thickness and topography, the python interface can compute it. The
major advantage of this method is that the python expression can be readily
evaluated on whatever meshes the AMR scheme throws up without the need for
interpolation. For example, create a function</p>
<pre>
#file foo.py
import math

def friction(x,y,t,thck,topg):
    friction = 1.01e+3 + 1.0e+3 * math.sin(x * 1.0e+3)*math.sin(y * 1.0e+3)
    return friction   
</pre>
in a python module and set
<pre>
geometry.beta_type = Python
PythonBasalFriction.module = foo
PythonBasalFriction.function = friction
</pre>
in the configuration file.
</p>


<h4>LevelData Basal Friction</h4>

<p>See also the description of the <a href='leveldatainterface.html'>LevelData interface</a>.</p>

<p>If  beta^2 cannot be expressed as a simple function, it might be represented
as data on a uniform mesh. Typically, this will be the case
if beta^2 was computed from observations in some way. BISICLES will
average or interpolate the data as needed as meshes are generated, with one
caveat: the data mesh spacing must be compatible with
the AMR scheme. Typically, the <strong>data level grid</strong>
will usually have a resolution that coincides with one of the AMR levels.
For example, to read the field btrc from a file basal.2d.hdf5:
</p>
<pre>
geometry.beta_type = LevelData
inputLevelData.frictionFile = basal.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.frictionName = btrc
</pre>
It is also possible to use a number of files to make a time-dependent
beta^2. E.g, 
<pre>
geometry.beta_type = LevelData
inputLevelData.frictionFileFormat = basal%4d.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.frictionFileStartTime = 0.0
inputLevelData.frictionFileTimeStep = 1.0
inputLevelData.frictionName = btrc
</pre>
<p>
will interpolate data in time between the files basal0000.2d.hdf5,basal0001.2d.hdf5,... 
</p>

<h4>MultiLevelData Basal Friction</h4>

Essentially the same as having a LevelData basal friction coefficient, but with a non-uniform mesh.
Tricky in practice, but, e.g
<pre>
geometry.beta_type = MultiLevelData
inputLevelData.frictionFile = basal.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.frictionName = btrc
</pre>


<h4>Others</h4>

Other beta^2 options include sinusoidalBeta, sinusoidalBetay, twistyStreamx, singularStream, gaussianBump.
These exist for testing to be carried out without the python interface: don't worry about them.

<h3><a name='bratefac'>Basal rate factor</a></h3>

  If you have built the doxygen code documentation, the C++ class hierarchy underlying
  the rate factor is described at <a href='../code/doc/doxygen/html/classRateFactor.html'>classRateFactor.html</a>

<h4><a name='btrrpwr'>Power law basal friction relation</a></h4>

<p>
The power law basal friction relation covers rules of the form tau_b = C |u|^{m-1} u, 
which includes linear viscous sliding (m=1), and hard bed sliding (m=1/3), and yield stress sliding (m=0.9999, though this will not work well).
For example, specify the common third power law by setting tau_b = C |u|^{-2/3} u
</p>
<pre>
main.basalFrictionRelation = powerLaw
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.m = 0.3333 # for m = 1/3
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.includeEffectivePressure = false #optional false is the default
</pre>
<p>
If
</p>
<pre>
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.includeEffectivePressure = true
</pre>
Then a factor hab^m (where hab is the thickness above flotation) is introduced. 

<h4><a name='btrrlim'>Pressure limited basal friction relation</a></h4>

<p>
The pressure limited law modifies another basal friction relation f(C,u) to ensure that
basal traction cannot exceed the Coulomb friction, proportional to the effective pressure N.
Two forms are implemented, the version from Tsai 2015, where |tau_b| = min( a * N, f(C,u) ),
and the version from Leguy 2014 (also Schoof 2005 and Gagliardini 2007), where 
|tau_b| = 
</p>
<p>
To choose Tsai 2015, set
</p>
<pre>
main.basalFrictionRelation = pressureLimitedLaw
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.coefficient = 0.5 #for example. Coulomb friction coefficient. should be 0 < a < 1 
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.model = Tsai
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.basalFrictionRelation = powerLaw
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.m = 0.3333
</pre>
<p>
To choose Leguy 2014, set
</p>
<pre>
main.basalFrictionRelation = pressureLimitedLaw
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.coefficient = 8.0e12  #for example
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.model = Leguy
BasalFrictionPressureLimitedLaw.basalFrictionRelation = powerLaw
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.m = 0.3333
</pre>


<h2><a name='englacial'>Englacial stresses</a></h2>

<p>
  The englacial stress model is broken down into a spatially varying <a href='#mucoef'>stiffness factor</a> phi(x,y)  
  and temperature dependent <a href='#ratefac'>rate factor</a> A(T),  which do not depend on velocity  and a
  <a href='#mu'>relation</a> f ( A,  grad u), which does, to provide an effective viscosity  phi f (A, grad u).
  The simplest model is a linear rheology (constant f). Ice sheet models will usually need either 
  Glen's flow law or a rule based on it such as the L1L2 rule (Schoof and Hindmarsh 2010). There is 
  also an experimental rule that combines any other relation with a continuum damage model.

<h3><a name='mu'>Englacial Constitutive relation</a> </h3>

<p>
  The englacial constitutive relation has three roles. First, it computes the effective
  viscosity (mu) given the strain rate (e_ij) and rate factor (A), so that the stress
  components are given by t_ij = mu * e_ij. Secondly, it computes the rate of strain
  heating (usually mu * e_ij * e_ji). Thirdly, it is currenty  responsible for
  reconstructing the velocity field u(x,y,z) from the basal velocity u_b(x,y), though
  this is slated for change when non-vertically integrated stresses are supported.
