  <H1>BISICLES Pine Island Glacier inverse problem</H1>
  <p> These instructions assume that you have working BISICLES executables, including  driver 
    and nctoamr. If that is not the case, there are some <a href='readme.html'>BISICLES build instructions</a>. 
    Anne Le Brocq has provided us with the data for this application - thanks Anne. You also
    need to have followed at least the preprocessing step of the first <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a>,
    up to the point where you create the file &quot;pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5&quot;
  </p> 

  <p>
    The basal traction field used in the <a href='pineisland.html'>Pine Island Glacier example</a> does not
    result in a model velocity that is a close match to the observations it is based, especially
    in the ice shelf and grounding line. That because the calculation ignored englacial viscous stresses, which
    are at least as important as basal stresses close to an upstream from the grounding line, and
    are the only stresses in the ice shelf. One way to improve on this is to solve a more sophisticated 
    inverse problem, where we try to find basal traction and viscosity coefficients that minimise
    the mismatch between model and observed speed integrated over the domain, subject to the stress balance equation 
    being satisfied. BISICLES solves this problem using a nonlinear conjugate gradient method, which the
    solution of both the stress balance equation and an equation involving the adjoint of the stress operator. 
    For details, see our paper, 
    <a href='http://www.the-cryosphere.net/9/1579/2015/'>Century-scale simulations of the response of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to a warming climate </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To solve the inverse problem, we simply need to switch stress solver type.
    Edit one of the config files (config_file), appending the lines:

  </p>
  <pre>
    main.maxTime = 0 #we don't want time dependence, yet

    amr.velocity_solver_type = 6 # Inverse problem !
    control.velMisfitType = speed # match observed speed (not velocity)
    
    #field of data expressing confidence in speed observations. 0 for no confidence
    control.velCoef.type = LevelData
    control.velCoef.fileFormat = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
    control.velCoef.name = velc
    control.velCoef.n = 1

    #x-component of the observed velocity (could be the speed if the y-component is zero)
    control.xVel.type = LevelData
    control.xVel.fileFormat = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
    control.xVel.name = xvel
    control.xVel.n = 1

    #y-component of the observed velocity (could be the speed if the x-component is zero))
    control.yVel.type = LevelData
    control.yVel.fileFormat = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
    control.yVel.name = yvel
    control.yVel.n = 1

    #Tikhonov regularization coefficients
    control.gradCsqRegularization = 1.0e+4
    control.gradMuCoefsqRegularization = 1.0e+10

    #some box constraints. 
    control.boundMethod = Projection
    control.lowerX0 = -5
    control.upperX0 = 5.0
    control.lowerX1 = -2.0
    control.upperX1 = 0.5
    
    control.writeInnerSteps = false
    control.CGmaxIter = 24


    control.optimizeX0 = true # default true: optimize w.r.t basal friction coeffcient (C)
    control.optimizeX1 = true # default true: optimize w.r.t effective viscosity coeffcient (muCoef)
  </pre>
  <p>
    Configured this way, the inverse problem will first be solved on the coarse mesh,
    then the mesh will be refined according to the solution, the inverse problem
    solved on that mesh, and so on. To save time, it is possible to delay solution
    of the inverse problem until after the mesh has been refined, provided that
    it is reasonable to tag and refine the mesh based on velocity observations.
  </p>
  <pre>    
    control.minLevelForOptimization = 2
  </pre>
  <p>
    Make sure this value is less than or equal to the finest mesh level - or
    the inverse problem will never be solved, and BISICLES will attempt to
    evolve the ice sheet according to the observed velocity.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is usually necessary to refine the mesh a little differently
    in inverse problems. First, it is often useful to refine fast flow
    to resolve ice streams (rather than shear margins) because observed velocities
    can be noisy. Second, velocity can depend rather strongly on pinning
    points (grounded spots in ice shelf regions). If the pinning points
    are small, they may be missed at low resolution. There are options
    designed for both of these issues.
  </p>
  <pre>
#refine generously in ice streams
amr.tag_vel_dx = true
amr.vel_dx_tagging_val = 5.0e+5 # refine 500 m/a regions to 1 km
amr.vel_dx_finest_level_grounded = 2
amr.vel_dx_finest_level_floating = 1

#tag thin submarine cavities in an attempt to refine around pinning points
amr.tag_thin_cavity = true
amr.tag_thin_cavity_thickness = 50.0
  </pre>
  <p>
    There is example inverse problem config file containing all the options above,
    inputs.pig.ctrl, in the Pine Island Glacier example
    directory. The inverse problem code is run with the same driver as the main code, e.g
</p>
<pre>
    > nohup mpirun -np 4 $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex inputs.pig.ctrl &
 </pre>
    As before, log output is directed to stdout in serial and to files called pout.0, pout.1, ... when run
    in parallel. Most of the computational effort is spent solving the stress-balance equations and adjoint stress-balance
    equations.
</p>

<p>
  BISICLES uses a conjugate gradient (CG) method to minimise an objective function.
  You can check the progress of the CG iterations by filtering all but a few lines from the log output,
  e.g

</pre>
  <p>
    The quantity ||fm(x)||^2 is the main part of the objective function, and ||fp(x)||^2 is the
    penalty function. At first, ||fm(x)||^2 is reduced quickly, then its rate of improvement slows down
    - this stage usually corresponds to &quot;overfitting&quot;, where higher frequency
    components creep into the solution. The parameter control.CGhang determines the
    relevant ratio  (||fm(x)||^2/||fm_old(x)||^2) between the current and previous CG iteration
    - here we have picked 0.95, which is rather low for time independent problems.
    The default is 0.999. Once ||fm(x)||^2/||fm_old(x)||^2 exceeds CGhang the inverse problem solver
    judges the problem to be solved well enough, and returns the 
    resulting fields to the main program. The main program (assuming it is not complete)
    then refines the mesh according to
    whatever criteria are set in the config file, and could either construct a new inverse problem
    with the coarser mesh solution (the basal traction and viscosity coefficients) as an initial
    guess, or (if specified) carry out a time step.
  </p>
<p>
  A file is written at the end of every CG iteration which contains the current
  estimate of the solution. These are currently named like ControlOuter??lev.??????.2d.hdf5
  (e.g ControlOuter.1lev.000002.2d.hdf5 at the end of iteration 2 after 1 level of refinement). 
  The most useful are the observed and modelled velocities (velox,veloy) and (velbx,velby), and
  the solution muCoef (the coefficient of viscosity) and C (the basal traction coefficient).
  The latter two can be extracted and e.g written to a flat file, and can then
  be read (through the <a href='leveldatainterface.html'>LevelData interface</a>) for use 
  in forward model runs. As we can see in the figures below, the model and observed speed
  are  quite close after 24 CG iterations
</p>

<p>
  Note that you can't just solve the inverse problem and get the right answer.
  It is ill-posed, both in that there are more parameters than data, and that
  some parameter vectors (short-wavelength variations) are likely to be spurious 
  (overfitting). The Tikhonov regularization parameters can be used to address
  both, but they are somewhat arbitrary and it is necessary to employ
  some sort of heuristic (e.g an L-curve plot) to choose them.
</p>
<p>
  There is another fly in the ointment, at least in Pine Island Glacier. If you
  run the forward problem with the resulting muCoef  and C, the glacier
  will thicken quickly (100 m/a) at the grounding line. This is not a model
  issue in particular, but a discrepancy between the observed velocity and
  thickness. There is a tall ridge under the grounding line, which 
  would mean either (1) the ice must be stretching as it moves downstream - in which
  case the observed velocity cannot be correct, or (2) 
  PIG should have seen thickening and GL advance in the 2000's - which observations
  of thinning and GL retreat tend to refute, or (3), the ridge is much lower. 
  (3) seems most  likely, see e.g Rignot et al 2014. 
</p>

<p>
  If we assume (3), we can at least get an idea of how the ridge needs to drop
  by evolving the thickness, but changing the bed rather than the surface. Add
  <pre>
    amr.evolve_topography_fix_surface = true     #bed relaxation
    main.maxTime = 10 
  </pre>
  to the config file. Every timestep, the bedrock will be updated, and then
  the inverse problem will be re-solved to keep C and muCoef in line.
  This is by no means the ultimate answer to this problem (and if it was, we
  would have published it :)
