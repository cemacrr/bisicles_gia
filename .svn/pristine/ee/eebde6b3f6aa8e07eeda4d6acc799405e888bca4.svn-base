CalvingModel examples, free floating ice shelf
----------------------------------------------
files used: mimsip3D.py,  inputs.mismip3D.Benn.calve

Model was spun up with inputs.mismip3D.spinup, and produced a checkoint file chk.mismip3D.Benn.ssa.0lev.013000.2d.hdf5


Example starts from there, with inputs.mismip3D.Benn.calve. Crevasse water depth wd is set in crevasse_water_depth,py,
which gives wd = 0 for the first 50 years (resulting in no calving events and the front remaining at the domain edge), 
then wd = 25.0 for 50 years, which results in the front moving to around x = 600 km, and fluctuating around that point.
At t = 100 years wd is set to 20.0, so that the front advances to around x = 650 km. 

For comparison, inputs.mismip3D.thickness.calve applies a simple minimumn thickness criterion, and removes 
ice shelf thinner than 500 m

The grounded ice should be completely unaffacted by these perturbations (and indeed and changes to the ice shelf)
