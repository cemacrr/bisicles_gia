BennCalvingModel examples:

1. Free floating ice shelf
--------------------------
files used: mimsip3D.py, inputs.mismip3D.Benn.spinup , inputs.mismip3D.Benn.calve

First, run with inputs.mismip3D.Benn.spinup, which has

CalvingModel.type = BennCalvingModel
CalvingModel.waterDepth = 0.0
CalvingModel.front_hi = 1 0
CalvingModel.front_lo = 0 0

Once is it complete, run with

inputs.mismip3D.Benn.calve, which has

CalvingModel.type = BennCalvingModel
CalvingModel.waterDepth = 25.0
CalvingModel.front_hi = 1 0
CalvingModel.front_lo = 0 0

amr.restart_file = 

The shelf should retreat from the domain edge to a position about 50 km downstream from the grounding line
