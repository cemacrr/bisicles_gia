This example sets up and runs a Greenland example based on the SeaRise
Greenland_5km_dev1.2.nc dataset (since that's the only one which
conveniently also had balance velocities in it). This example looks
and feels very similar to the PineIslandGlacier example, which isn't
terribly surprising since it's based on it.

To set up example:
1. compile friction code (gmake all, assuming that definitions in
BISICLES/code/mk are set up correctly)

2. run friction code, which reads in fields in balvelmag_5gis.dat  thck_5gis.dat
topg_5gis.dat (the balance velocities, ice thickness, and bedrock
topography which have been extracted from the original nc datafile)
and computes an approximate basal friction field, then writes it out
to Greenland-bisicles-5km.nc.

3. run nctoamr to convert netcdf->BISICLES-readable hdf5. For example:

../../code/filetools/nctoamr2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.OPT.ex
Greenland-bisicles-5km.nc Greenland-bisicles-5km.2d.hdf5 thck topg
beta temp000000 temp000001 temp000002 temp000003 temp000004 temp000005
temp000006 temp000007 temp000008 temp000009 

4. generate inputs files: ./make_inputs.sh

5. run code. For example: 

../../code/exec2D/driver2d*.ex inputs.GIS.5km.l1l2.l4
